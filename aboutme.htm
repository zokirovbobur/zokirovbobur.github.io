                        <p class="movietext">Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed, co-written, 
                            and co-produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, 
                            Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian 
                            future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts 
                            who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.

                            Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, 
                            which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. 
                            Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, 
                            through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through 
                            Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an 
                            executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, 
                            The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures 
                            co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in anamorphic 
                            format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta 
                            (Canada), Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature
                             effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.</p>
